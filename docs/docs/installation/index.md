# ðŸ“¦ Installation

> [!CAUTION]
> For security reasons, I do not recommend running scripts from the internet unless you understand what they are doing. If you are not a developer, I recommend reading the comments in the code and/or asking a LLM like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) or [Claude](https://claude.ai) to explain it to you.

There are multiple ways to install the script.

I recommend using a userscript manager because it will keep the script up-to-date and run it automatically when you visit the appropriate page. If you don't want to do that, you can also run it manually.
