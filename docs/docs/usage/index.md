# üïπÔ∏è Usage

Learn about script features and how to use them in this section.

## Definitions

We use the same terminology as Komoot:

| Term         | Definition                                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Activity** | What you actually did (recorded or uploaded). |
| **Route**    | A planned path.                               |
| **Tour**     | Umbrella term for both routes and activities. |

Some features work with both activities and routes. In this case, we may use the word `tour` to talk about both of them at once.

## Supported Pages

The script adds enhancements to the following pages:

| Name      | Path                                                            | Features                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tour list | `/user/YOUR_USER_ID/routes` and `/user/YOUR_USER_ID/activities` | <ul><li>Tags are extracted from tour titles and shown as pills.</li><li>Checkboxes are added to filter tours by tags.</li><li>A button is added to force load all tours.</li></ul> |

All UI elements added to the Komoot website have a lizard icon (ü¶é) in the top right corner so they can be easily identified.
