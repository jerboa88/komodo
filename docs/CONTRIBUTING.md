## Guidelines

The [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification is used for commit messages. [SemVer](https://semver.org/) is used for versioning.

## Tech Stack

This project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/) and [vite-plugin-monkey](https://github.com/lisonge/vite-plugin-monkey) to bundle the code into a single file that can be installed as a userscript.

We use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for package management. You can use another package manager if you want, but you'll have to replace refererences to `bun` or `bunx` in the following places:

- Script commands in `package.json`
- Husky hooks in `.husky/*`
- Workflows in `.github/workflows/*`

Commit conventions are enforced using [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) via [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) pre-commit hooks. [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) is set up as well, so you can use `bun commit` to commit changes using an interactive prompt instead of `git commit` if you wish.

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) is used for linting and formatting.

[Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) is used to automate the release process.

[Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/) is used to build the documentation site at [komodo.johng.io](https://komodo.johng.io).
